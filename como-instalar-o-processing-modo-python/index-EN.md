# How to install Processing Python Mode

> [!WARNING]
> 
> Only use **Processing Python Mode** if you need to run legacy projects that depend on it. Also, it is incompatible with Processing 4.x. If you are starting to learn Processing and Python, check out "[How to install and use **py5**](https://abav.lugaralgum.com/como-instalar-py5/index-EN.html)" instead.

### What's this?

[**Processing**](http://processing.org) is a Free and Open Source (FLOSS) programming platform started in 2001 by Casey Reas e Ben Fry, widely used by artists and to teach coding in a visual context. The Processing IDE is a text editor for code that can quickly execute your programs, called *sketches*.

With Processing you can not only generate raster and vector graphics, but interactive applications running on Linux, macOS or Windows. It's community benefits from a rich ecossystem of people creating and sharing educational resources and code libraries.

Standard Processing is based on the **Java** programming language but there are two other projects supported by the Processing Foundation that you might want to try:

- [P5\*JS](https://p5js.org/) (a **JavaScript** library );
- [Processing Python Mode](https://py.processing.org/) (based on Jython, a **Python 2.7** implementation running on the JVM).

Both can be added to the traditional Processing IDE. So let's see **how to install Processing Python Mode** (which hopefully is the reason you are reading this).

### Installation steps

#### 1. Visit the releases at the Processing site (<http://www.processing.org/releases>), select Processing 3.5.4 for your OS.

#### 2. There is no installer, you just unzip/extract a folder. This is how it looks on Windows:

On macOS it's almost the same, and on Linux, you can open a Terminal window, point it to the decompressed downloaded folder and type *./processing* (you may also want to execute *install.sh* and that should create a nice desktop shortcut to Processing)

#### 3. Once the Processing IDE is launched, look for the modes menu on the top right corner and select *Add modeâ€¦*

#### 4. Select the Python Mode on the list and click *Install* to get it.

> \[If this fails, see more instructions down below].

#### 5. Check if installation has finished with a green mark and select "Python" at the modes menu!

You might need to close and open again the Processing IDE. A *Processing* folder will be created under the user's *Documents* on Windows and macOS (On Linux the folder is called *sketchbook*), there you'll find your *sketches* (programms), tools, modes and libraries. This is how it looks when you've finished:

**Notes:**

- If you are under some restrictive proxy our without Internet acess you can download [PyhtonMode.zip](http://py.processing.org/3/PythonMode.zip) and manualy copy it (on Windows & Mac OS) under *Documentos &gt; Processing &gt; modes &gt;* PythonMode. On Linux, under your *sketchbook* folder/material-aulas. 
- Firewalls may disturb Python Mode as there is a helper process that tries to connect online. 
- Another known issue is working with non-ASCII OS usernames & paths.

#### How about a sketch to test it?
